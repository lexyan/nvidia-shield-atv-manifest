Before flashing images from this build to your SHIELD, connect your SHIELD
via USB with the port closest to Fan exhaust to the PC where you built this tree.

Next, put your SHIELD into fastboot mode using following method:
Controller method:
1. Connect SHIELD Controller using USB cable
2. Use USB port near HDMI port for the Controller and USB port away for PC connection
3. Hold Button-A and Button-B on SHIELD Controller and then insert power adapter to SHIELD
4. Wait until you see Fastboot menu on HDMI display
5. Use X/Y to navigate
6. Use A to select

Fastboot menu navigation:
1.  Use X/Y to navigate
2.  Use A to select

If this is the first time you have done this procedure, you must unlock
your bootloader. To unlock your bootloader, run the following command
in a terminal:

fastboot oem unlock

It will take you to '!!! READ THE FOLLOWING !!!' page.
Two selectable options are available. 'Confirm' and 'Back to menu'.
Select 'Confirm' to unlock the bootloader.

Your device's bootloader should now be unlocked.

To flash images from this build to your SHIELD, run the following commands
from the same terminal where you did your build:

fastboot oem dtbname                  (This will print the DTB name for a given product)

cd $OUT
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash system system.img
fastboot flash vendor vendor.img
fastboot flash dtb <DTB file name>    (Use result from "fastboot oem dtbname" in <DTB file name>)
fastboot reboot
